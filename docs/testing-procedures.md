# Testing and Validation Procedures

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive testing procedures to validate that the Microsoft 365 authentication fix is working correctly and users can access M365 services seamlessly.

## Pre-Testing Checklist

Before beginning tests, ensure:

- [ ] Implementation guide has been completed
- [ ] Registry configurations have been applied
- [ ] Group Policy settings have been deployed
- [ ] Azure AD Connect synchronization is operational
- [ ] Test user accounts are prepared
- [ ] Backup and rollback procedures are documented

## Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Technical Validation

#### 1.1 Registry Configuration Test

**Objective**: Verify all required registry settings are in place

**Procedure**:
```powershell
# Run the validation script
.\scripts\validate-setup.ps1 -TestAllComponents -GenerateReport

# Check specific registry values manually
$regPaths = @(
    "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Identity",
    "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\ZoneMap\Domains\microsoftonline.com\login"
)

foreach ($path in $regPaths) {
    if (Test-Path $path) {
        Write-Host "✅ Found: $path" -ForegroundColor Green
        Get-ItemProperty -Path $path | Format-List
    } else {
        Write-Host "❌ Missing: $path" -ForegroundColor Red
    }
}
```

**Expected Results**:
- All registry paths exist
- EnableADAL = 1 for Office authentication
- Trusted sites configured for Azure AD URLs

#### 1.2 Network Connectivity Test

**Objective**: Confirm connectivity to M365 authentication endpoints

**Procedure**:
```powershell
# Test critical M365 endpoints
$endpoints = @(
    "login.microsoftonline.com:443",
    "outlook.office365.com:443", 
    "graph.microsoft.com:443"
)

foreach ($endpoint in $endpoints) {
    $url, $port = $endpoint -split ":"
    $result = Test-NetConnection -ComputerName $url -Port $port -InformationLevel Quiet
    
    if ($result) {
        Write-Host "✅ $endpoint : Connected" -ForegroundColor Green
    } else {
        Write-Host "❌ $endpoint : Failed" -ForegroundColor Red
    }
}
```

**Expected Results**:
- All endpoints should be reachable
- Response times should be reasonable (< 2 seconds)

#### 1.3 Domain Authentication Test

**Objective**: Verify domain integration is functioning

**Procedure**:
```powershell
# Check domain membership and UPN
Write-Host "Computer Domain: $env:USERDOMAIN"
Write-Host "User: $env:USERNAME"

# Test UPN resolution
$upn = whoami /upn
if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
    Write-Host "✅ User UPN: $upn" -ForegroundColor Green
} else {
    Write-Host "❌ UPN not available" -ForegroundColor Red
}

# Test domain controller connectivity
$dcTest = nltest /dsgetdc:$env:USERDOMAIN
if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
    Write-Host "✅ Domain controller accessible" -ForegroundColor Green
} else {
    Write-Host "❌ Domain controller connection failed" -ForegroundColor Red
}
```

**Expected Results**:
- Computer is domain-joined
- User has valid UPN
- Domain controller is accessible

- No manual credential entry required
- Seamless access to all services

**Test Case: Azure AD Portal**

**Procedure**:
1. Navigate to portal.azure.com
2. Monitor authentication behavior
